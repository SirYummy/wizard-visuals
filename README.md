# Wizard Visuals
- When the app first starts, a list of configurable questions about wizard demographics will appear.  
- Each question will include 1 or more dropdown options embedded within the body of the question.  These options will be related to "wizard variables."  
- Once all dropdowns for a given question are set, then all other questions "magically" disappear and a chart fulfilling the answer to the aforementioned question will "magically" appear.
